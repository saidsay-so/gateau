### Output (Piping) Cookies

#### cookies.txt Format (curl, wget)

You can output cookies in Netscape "cookies.txt" format and pipe them to curl or wget.

**Using curl:**

```bash
curl -b <(gateau output --format netscape) https://example.com
```

In this example, gateau will output cookies from Firefox in Netscape format, and curl will import those which match the requested domains and use them for the request.

**Using wget:**

```bash
wget --load-cookies <(gateau output --browser=chrome --format netscape) https://example.com
```

In this example, gateau will output cookies from Chrome in Netscape format, and wget will import those which match the requested domains and use them for the request.

#### httpie Sessions

Output cookies in httpie session format (experimental).

**Using httpie:**

```bash
http --session-read-only <(gateau output --format httpie-session example.com) example.com
```

In this example, gateau will output cookies from Firefox in httpie session format, and httpie will import it as an anonymous session.

**Saving Named Sessions:**

```bash
HOST=adventofcode.com
SESSION_NAME=aoc
CONFIG_PATH=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}
gateau output --format=httpie-session $HOST > $CONFIG_PATH/httpie/sessions/$HOST/$SESSION_NAME.json
https --session=$SESSION_NAME $HOST
```

### Browser Session

Create a browser session within a new context and export the cookies after the session termination.

**Example:**

```bash
gateau wrap --browser=chromium --session -- curl https://example.com
```

### Wrapping Commands

Wrap commands (curl, wget, httpie) to import cookies directly.

**Example with curl:**

```bash
gateau wrap curl https://example.com
```

This will wrap the command `curl https://example.com` and import cookies for the request.

**Example with httpie:**

```bash
gateau wrap --browser=chromium http GET https://example.com
```

This will wrap the command `http GET https://example.com` and import cookies for the request.

### Piping vs Wrapping

#### Piping with Process Substitution

Piping is flexible and secure but requires a shell that supports process substitution.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -b <(gateau output --format netscape) https://example.com
```

#### Wrapping

Wrapping avoids the need for process substitution and temporary files but is limited to supported commands.

**Example:**

```bash
gateau wrap curl https://example.com
```

### Bypass Database File Locking

Use the `--bypass-lock` flag to bypass database file locking (not recommended).

**Example:**

```bash
gateau wrap --bypass-lock curl https://example.com
```
